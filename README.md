# GitHub Backup

Simple script to make a backup of all my (your?) GitHub repos. You'll need a
GitHub fine-grained personal access token with read access to metadata.

Note that fine-grained tokens only give access to your own (and public)
repositories; if you want to include private repositories you're a collaborator
on, you'll need a classic token with full repo access.
